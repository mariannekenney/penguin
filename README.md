# Penguin Road Racing School
### Website Modifications

This repository contains custom frontend work completed for the Penguin Racing School website. The original site was built using Wild Apricot, and this repo represents an overhaul focused on improving layout, performance, and user experience while preserving compatibility with Wild Apricot’s platform constraints.

&nbsp;
## How It Works

The custom code is injected via a *Custom HTML Gadget* within Wild Apricot, which loads the compiled files from this repository. This approach enables dynamic behavior and layout control without modifying Wild Apricot’s core platform.

The custom frontend code is organized within a `src` folder, structured as follows:

- `custom-settings/` — Files related to *Custom Settings* 
- `event-details/` — Files related to *Event Details*
- `event-registration/` — Files related to *Event Registration*
- `backend.js` — Shared file for API call execution
- `style.css` — Main stylesheet
